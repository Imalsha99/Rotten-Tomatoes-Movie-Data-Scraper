# Rotten-Tomatoes-Movie-Data-Scraper
Rotten Tomatoes Movie Data Scraper is a Python project utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup to automate web scraping of movie information from the Rotten Tomatoes website. The script navigates through pages, clicks the 'Load More' button, and extracts movie details such as names, Tomatometer scores, and audience scores. The scraped data is then stored in lists for further analysis or visualization. This project is designed for educational purposes of Natural Language Processing based applications and demonstrates web scraping techniques with a focus on extracting movie-related data from a popular review platform.
